Welcome! My name is Rita and I am a PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico and INESC-ID, supervised by [Professor Emanuel Gonçalves](http://web.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/emanuel.v.goncalves/) and [Professor Susana Vinga](http://web.ist.utl.pt/susanavinga/).

My research focus is on developing computational approaches and machine-learning models to analyze high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and complex biological data. Currently, my goal is to design and explore deep learning models to integrate large-scale cancer multi-omics datasets from both preclinical and clinically relevant cancer samples. Ultimately, within the scope of precision cancer medicine, these models will enable predictions of cellular phenotypes and treatment outcomes for patients that could be used to prioritize the most effective drug treatments for clinical validation.
